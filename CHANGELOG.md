Change Log
==========

This file documents all notable changes to Peggy.

Unreleased
----------

Released: TBD (Not before 2025-05-01)

### Major Changes

- BREAKING: Generated code no longer supports ES5.  You can still generate
  commonjs or es6 exports, but the code itself requires ES2020.  If you need
  to support earlier runtimes, you should use a transpiler such as Babel.
  Generated code now uses `const` and `let`, but is still not strict about
  using `const` wherever possible, due to the complexities of code generation.
  Work-arounds and polyfills for class extension, padding, and `Object.assign`
  have been removed in favor of their ES2020 equivalents.
  [#593](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/593)
- BREAKING: Node.js v20+ is now required for the CLI tools.  No testing is
  performed on earlier versions of Node, and no issues will be fixed for
  earlier versions. [#593](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/593)
- BREAKING: The SyntaxError class exported from generated parsers is now a
  proper subclass of the built-in ECMAscript SyntaxError class.  The name of
  the type has changed to `PeggySyntaxError`, which may cause some slight need
  for rework in TypeScript-aware projects.  This was the main driver behind
  moving away from ES5. [#593](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/593)
- BREAKING: The output of AMD and UMD modules is no longer supported.  As far
  as we can tell, AMD isn't used anymore, and folks using UMD can either use
  a bundler, switch to es6 modules, or output both a globals format parser and
  a commonjs parser if absolutely required.
  [#598](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/598)

### New features


### Bug fixes

- All libraries used in the web site brought up-to-date, versioned with all
  other dependencies, and served locally. (TODO: Old version of CodeMirror to
  be replaced with Monaco). [#593](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/593)
- Code coverage increased for Peggy Grammar parser.
  [#593](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/593)
- Minor changes in code generation for parsers.  More consistent indentation,
  trailing commas (for consistency with the Peggy house style).
  [#593](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/593)

### Documentation

- Link to browserlist support matrix in documentation.
  [#593](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/593)
- When clicking on the link to the examples grammar, do not download the
  .peggy file, but instead show a .peggy.txt file in a browser window.
  [#595](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/595)
- Set a minimum height for the editors in the online version.

4.0.0
-----

Released: 2024-02-13

### Major Changes

- [#379](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/issues/379) Fix infinite recursion
  issue by moving reportInfiniteRecursion to the new prepare pass, and having
  it fail after finding the first issue.  This will require plugin authors
  to ensure that reportInfiniteRecursion is in the new pass correctly.
- [#417](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/417) BREAKING: change to AST to
  allow topLevelInitializer and initializer to be arrays, in support of
  multi-file inputs.  This will require plugin updates.  The CLI and API now
  take multiple files as input, where the first file is your main library, and
  subsequent files consist of a library of other rules.  The CLI can take file
  names of the form `npm:<package-name>/<filename>` to load library rules from
  an NPM package that is installed relative to the previous non-npm file name,
  or to the current working directory if this is the first file name.
- [#420](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/420) BREAKING: Node v16+ is now
  required for running the CLI or using Peggy as a library.  Generated code
  still targets older runtimes.
- [#456](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/456) BREAKING: Allow imports
  from external compiled grammars inside a source grammar, using `import
  {rule} from "external.js"`.  Note that this syntax will generate either
  `import` or `require` in the JavaScript output, depending on the value of
  the `format` parameter.  This will need explicit support from
  plugins, with a few new AST node types and a few visitor changes.
- [#463](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/issues/463) Drop support for
  Internet Explorer.  Move to eslint flat configs in order to lint minimized
  browser code for compatibility with
  `defaults, maintained node versions, not op_mini all`.

### Minor Changes

- [#400](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/400) Use `@generated` in generated
  code

  to the command line interface.
- [#415](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/issues/415) Added `browser` key to package.json, pointing to Webpack output.
- [#420](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/420) Updated dependencies to
  avoid audit warnings.
- [#425](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/425) Add a pass to simplify single-character choices
- [#427](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/427) Avoid double extraction of
  substrings in various MATCH_ bytecodes
- [#430](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/430) Make generate-js.js ts clean
- [#432](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/432) Add peggy.code-workspace
- [#435](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/435) Setup tsconfig to detect use of library functions from es6 or later
- [#436](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/436) Get rid of tsd
- [#437](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/437) Better type checking for visitor
- [#438](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/438) Make test build deterministic
- [#439](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/439) Make peg$computePosDetails a little faster
- [#440](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/issues/440) Create directories for
  output and source-map if they do not exist, rather than erroring.
- [#446](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/446) Add a right-associative `ExponentiationExpression` rule (operator `**`) to `javascript.pegjs` example grammar.
- [#451](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/451) Make stack.js ts clean
- [#452](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/452) Fixes to prepare generate-bytecode.js for ts-check
- [#453](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/453) Make generate-bytecode.js ts-clean
- [#460](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/453) Allow `-t` and `-T` testing
  from the CLI with `--format es`.

### Bug Fixes

- [#374](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/issues/374) CLI throws exception
  on grammar errors. From @hildjj
- [#381](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/issues/381) Repetitions with code blocks
  for min or max not handling non-integer returns correctly.  From @hildjj.
- [#382](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/382) Update grammarSource
  documentation.  From @AndrewRayCode.
- [#384](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/issues/384) Improve the error.format()

3.0.1
-----

Released: 2022-03-05

### Minor Changes

- [#329](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/issues/329) Allow plugin options in
  generate.  This change loosens type checking strictness to allow for options
  unknown to Peggy, but used by plugins such as ts-pegjs.  From @hildjj.

### Bug Fixes

- [#329](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/issues/329) Allow type definition for ParserBuildOptions to include plugin options.  From @hildjj.
- [#346](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/issues/346) Allow extra semicolons
  between rules.  From @hildjj.
- [#347](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/issues/347) Disallow '$' as an initial
  character in identifiers.  This is not a breaking change because no grammar
  could have successfully used these in the past.  From @hildjj.
- [#354](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/354) Various minor nits in the
  docs, including indentation and ensuring that the CNAME file is correct.
- [#357](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/issues/357) Fix infinite recursion
  possibility in repetition delimeters.  From @hildjj and @Mingun.
- [#359](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/issues/359) Do not treat as many
  words as reserved.  Clarify the documentation about identifiers.  Ensure
  that it is more clear that the target language being generated determines
  what words are reserved.  Clarify that reserved word checking is only
  done for labels.  From @nene.
- [#364](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/issues/364) Fix passing an incorrect
  external label to the expression inside the `repeated` node.  From @Mingun.

3.0.0
-----

Released: 2023-02-21

### Major Changes

- [#280](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/issues/280) Add inline examples to
  the documentation, from @hildjj
- [#240](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/issues/240) Generate SourceNodes for
  bytecode, from @hildjj
- [#338](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/338) BREAKING CHANGE. Update
  dependencies, causing minimum supported version of node.js to move to 14.
  Generated grammar source should still work on older node versions and some
  older browsers, but testing is currently manual for those. from @hildjj
- [#291](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/291): Add support for
  repetition operator `expression|min .. max, delimiter|`, from @Mingun
- [#339](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/339): BREAKING CHANGE. Updated
  the list of JavaScript reserved words. This will break existing grammars
  that use any of the new words in their rule or label names. from @hildjj

Important information for plug-in authors: PR #291 added 4 new opcodes to the bytecode:
- `IF_LT`
- `IF_GE`
- `IF_LT_DYNAMIC`
- `IF_GE_DYNAMIC`

and added a new AST node and a visitor method `repeated`. Do not forget to update your plug-ins.

Important information for grammar authors: the following words, which used to
be valid identifiers for rules and labels, are now treated as JavaScript
reserved words, and will cause errors at compile time if you are using them:

- abstract
- arguments
- as
- async
- boolean
- byte
- char
- double
- eval
- final
- float
- from
- get
- goto
- int
- long
- native
- of
- set
- short
- synchronized
- throws
- transient
- volatile

### Minor Changes

- [#274](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/issues/274) `"*"` is now a valid `allowedStartRule`, which means all rules are allowed, from @hildjj
- [#229](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/issues/229) new CLI option
  `-S <rule>` or `--start-rule <rule>` to specify the start rule when testing,
  from @hildjj
- [#236](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/issues/236) Website: show line numbers
  in parser input textarea, from @Mingun

  from @hildjj
- [#285](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/issues/285) Require that a non-empty
  string be given as a grammarSource if you are generating a source map, from
  @hildjj
- [#206](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/206): New output type `ast` and
  an `--ast` flag for the CLI to get an internal grammar AST for investigation
  (can be useful for plugin writers), from @Mingun
- [#294](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/294) Website: show errors in the
  editors, from @Mingun
- [#297](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/297) Website: add Discord widget,
  from @hildjj

2.0.1
-----

Released: 2022-01-01

### Major Changes

- None

### Minor Changes

- [#261](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/261): Remove documentation from
  README.md, instead linking to the HTML documentation.  HTML documentation on
  <https://peggyjs.org> is now served from the `docs` branch, so that it won't
  update as we change the `main` branch.  `main` must be merged onto `docs` as
  a part of the release process going forward.
- [#266](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/issues/266): Expose the private
  field `problems` in the `Session` class, from @hildjj.

### Bug Fixes

- [#263](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/issues/263): Broken link to unpkg.
  This bug was a symptom of a relatively bad issue in the 2.0.0 release, where
  the web version of peggy was put in the wrong place, and therefore not
  tested in the release process.  From @hildjj.

2.0.0
-----

Released: 2022-05-28

### Major Changes

  more than a year ago.  Added support for Node.js version 18, from @hildjj
- [#251](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/251): Make `commander` and
  `source-map-generator` full dependencies.  These are not needed for the
  pre-packaged web build, but will be used by Node or people that are doing

  bug by throwing an exception if no grammarSource is given when generating
  source maps, from @hildjj.

1.2.0
-----

Released: 2021-06-02

### Minor Changes

- Infrastructural rebake [@StoneCypher](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/107)
    - Builds with `typescript`, removes `babel`
    - Bundles with `rollup`, removes `browserify`
    - Tests with `jest`, removes `mocha`
    - Minifies with `terser`, removes `uglify`
    - Adds `rimraf` for portable pre-build cleanup
    - Extends CI testing to `windows`, `macintosh`
    - Increases node testing range to include `node 16`
- Option to select optimization mode removed as it had no significant effect on the
  majority of generated parsers and as such represented only academic interest. You should
  use minifiers to get smaller parsers. Option `optimize` is deleted from the `generate()`
  options, flag `--optimize` is deleted from the CLI (you still can supply it, but the CLI
  will issue a warning that the option is removed).
  [@Mingun](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/147)
- `location()`s now will have additional `source` property which value is taken
  from the `options.grammarSource` property. That property can contain arbitrary
  data, for example, path to the currently parsed file.
  [@Mingun](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/95)
- Made usage of `GrammarError` and `peg$SyntaxError` more consistent.  Use the
  `format` method to get pretty string outputs.  Updated the `peggy` binary to
  make pretty errors. Slight breaking change: the format of a few error
  messages have changed; use the `toString()` method on `GrammarError` to get
  something close to the old text.
  [@hildjj](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/116)
- The code generator was slightly reworked to simplify reusing the bytecode generator
  (`generate.generateBytecode` pass). Property `consts` on the `grammar` AST node,
  has been creating by the pass in the past, was decoupled into 4 other properties
  with the structured information:
  - `literals`
  - `classes`
  - `expectations`
  - `functions`
- Added missing type definitions to the `peg.d.ts` file. Added definitions for the
  `compiler` and `visitor` modules, AST, and `plugins` option in the `generate()` function.
  [@Mingun](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/143)

  Now bytecode generation pass is independent from the JavaScript backend.
  [@Mingun](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/117)
- Some opcodes from `compiler/opcode.js` were deprecated. Although you shouldn't use
  them directly because they are not considered as a public API, some plugins use them.
  For that reason backward compatibility is preserved:
  - Opcode `MATCH_REGEXP` is deprecated and replaced by `MATCH_CHAR_CLASS` with the same value.
  - Added new opcode `PUSH_EMPTY_STRING` that puts a new empty string on the stack.
  - Opcode `PUSH` is deprecated because it was used only for pushing empty string constants
    and they now pushed with `PUSH_EMPTY_STRING`.

  Instead of relying on the library opcodes it is better to have a copy of
  them, especially if your plugin replaces both the `generateBytecode` and
  the `generateJs` passes. [@Mingun](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/117)
- Default visitor functions, returned by the `visitor.build()`, that just forward
  call to `node.expression`, now return the result of underlying `visit` call.
  [@Mingun](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/144)

  Affected functions:
    - `rule`
    - `named`
    - `action`
    - `labeled`
    - `text`
    - `simple_and`
    - `simple_not`
    - `optional`
    - `zero_or_more`
    - `one_or_more`
    - `group`
- Parsers now can use two new functions to get location information:
  `offset()` and `range()`. Use them if you don't need the whole
  location information, because it is expensive to compute.
  These two new functions are always very efficient (back-ported pegjs/pegjs#528).
  [@felix9 and @Mingun](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/145)
- Add a new option `config.reservedWords: string[]`, avalible for plugins in their
  `use()` method. Using this option, a plugin can change the list of words that
  cannot be used.

  By default this new option contains an array with [reserved JavaScript words][reserved]
  [@Mingun](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/150)
- Several optimizations in the generator. Generated parsers should now be faster and smaller

### Bug fixes

- [#112](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/112): `"group"` node in the AST now have `location` information (back-ported)
- [#143](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/143): `peg.d.ts` had some errors in the type descriptions, which were fixed


1.1.0
-----

Released: 2021-04-22

### Major Changes

- Added global initializer blocks, which contain code that is only run once
  when the grammar is loaded, rather than once every time the parser runs.
  Global initializers are surrounded by `{{` and `}}`, and must come before
  the per-parser initializer, which is surrounded by `{` and `}`.
  [@jaubourg](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/73)
- Back-ported value plucking with `@` from pegjs head.  If your rule has a simple action that returns one or more of the values matched by the rule, you can instead mark those expressions with `@` and not need an action.  This works inside of parens as well.  [@hildjj](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/89)
